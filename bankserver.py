Programming Tutorial - Online Banking System
Written by Tim Arney <t.arney@unsw.edu.au>

This file contains the server implementation for the online banking system.
The server listens for incoming requests from clients, processes the requests,
and sends a response back to the client.

The server is implemented using a UDP socket, and the server logic is executed
in a separate thread for each request.  This allows the server to handle
multiple clients concurrently.

The server uses a Bank object to manage the account information and process
the requests.  The Bank object is responsible for opening accounts, checking
balances, and transferring funds between accounts.  It is initialised with the
account information provided in a file.  The file should contain one account
per line, with the account name, hashed password, and balance separated by
whitespace.

The server is started by running the main() function, which reads the command
line arguments and initialises the server and bank objects.  The server is
then executed by calling its run() method.

Usage: python3 server.py <accounts_file> <server_port>
Example: python3 server.py accounts.tsv 54321
